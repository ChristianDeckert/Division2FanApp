The DPS Calculator is a free and indispensable tool for all division agents who are in the struggle for survival in Washington DC.

This is a fan project for Tom Clancy's Division 2 and is unrelated to Ubisoft, Massive or Redstorm. All trademarks belong to their respective owners and are used for informational purposes only.

The inspirational source was the DPS calculation sheet by MarcoStyle. Thanks a lot for this.
